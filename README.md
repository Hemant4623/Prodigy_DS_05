# Traffic Accident Analysis

 Project Overview
This project, completed during my data science internship at Prodigy Infotech, involves analyzing and visualizing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The goal is to identify accident hotspots and contributing factors.

 Dataset
Name: Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes
Source:[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nypd/vehicle-collisions)
Description: This dataset contains information about motor vehicle collisions in New York City, including details about road conditions, weather, and contributing factors.

 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of accidents.
- Analyze the impact of time of day and weather conditions on accident rates.
- Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

 Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

 Steps and Methodology
1. Data Loading and  Loaded the dataset and performed necessary cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of accidents by borough, time of day, and contributing factors.
3. Visualization: Created visualizations to identify accident hotspots and analyze the impact of various factors.
